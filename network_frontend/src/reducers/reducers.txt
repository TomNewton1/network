Reducers

Specify how the app's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. 
(actions describe what happens but don't acutally describe how the applications state changes. Reducers are in charge of that. )


A Reducer is a function that accepts state and action as arguments, and returns the next state of the application. 

In is simplest form you can represent a reducer as (previousState, action) => newState
